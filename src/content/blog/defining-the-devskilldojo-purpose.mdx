After sharing my initial (half-baked) plans for DevSkillDojo with some trusted
friends and colleagues, I was made very aware that I need to be clearer about
what I am REALLY trying to achieve here. Of course, I knew this, but it took
some time for the thoughts to coalesce into a cohesive purpose. Here's my first
attempt at defining it:

When we look at the world of software development, we are faced with two
undeniable truths:
1. The Skills Shortage is universal
2. There are more learning resources than ever

Many people, including me, have been living at the sharp end of the current
state of affairs. We feel like gladiators fighting in an arena against vicious
beasts like low quality software, project delays, late nights, early mornings,
changing requirements, ill-defined requirements and the worst beast of them all: 
Eventual Burnout. 

And in the stands we have the crowds of executives, sales people and project
managers who have come to watch the excitement, without putting any real skin in
the game.

Sometimes it's a painful show to be part of, but at the same time it is also
exhilarating! And I would not want to do anything else with my life. I would,
however, want to do it slightly differently. The first thing I would want to
change is to ensure that project teams actually have the skills they need to
deliver on the promises that they make (or sometimes the promises that have been
made on their behalf)

Like many other people, my natural instinct, when faced with colleagues who are
struggling to deliver on their responsibilities, is to think that I could solve
the problem by creating and presenting training. Whether in-person or through
some electronic medium of a document, or video, etc.

And based on the amount of training that we see online, I am clearly not the
only one.

But the voices in my head told me: Let's stop arrogantly thinking we know what
the solution is, and spend some time investigating the matter properly, i.e.
let's invest some time in proper analysis. Specifically, I'm thinking we should
approach the subject from multiple angles (including, but not limited to): 

1. Understand who are the stakeholders involved in this game, because there are actually quite a few (e.g. new developers, established tech leads, business analysts, execs, product owners, etc.)
2. Understand how the different stakeholders perceive the problem. How does it really affect their lives.
3. Understand how the different stakeholders are attempting to solve the problem in their own isolated ways.
4. Understand why these different, and independent, approaches are not 100% successful.

So the purpose of DevSkillDojo is really twofold:

1. Be a location to analyse to problem properly
2. Identify and implement practical solutions

So let me expand a little bit on what I mean with practical solutions (Keeping
in mind, that these solutions are likely to evolve as we learn more about the
problem itself)

Solve for: Listing and organising learning content
Instead of creating ever more learning content, we need to establish reliable
ways of finding, organising, categorising and rating existing learning material.
Effectively we want to do for learning material, what Google originally did for
websites.

Solve for: Using complementary types of learning material\nIn addition to simply categorising learning content according to topic, we
should also understand the different types of learning material available and
how to leverage each type effectively. This is important because people learn in
different ways: Some people read books, others watch videos, others follow
practical tutorials, etc. 

Additionally, different types of learning material serve different purposes. By
using them together we can achieve better results with a shorter turnaround
time. For example: One of the biggest struggles most learning developers face
today is called Tutorial Hell. This describes a situation where you follow along
with a tutorial and can complete the steps (which makes you think you've
mastered the material), but as soon as you need to build your own solution, you
have no clue how to proceed.

Tutorial Hell is a symptom of not understanding the fundamentals of the
tools/frameworks/approaches you are using. Solving this critical issue requires
the use of different types of learning material, including practical
assessments, open ended projects and contributions to relevant, real-world
projects. 

Solve for: Understand the skills required to succeed
In the ever-evolving technology landscape that we inhabit today we are faced
with new tools and techniques on a daily basis. At the same time, the skills
requirements for specific jobs are becoming more difficult to describe. 

For example: when employing a developer for a permanent position, you may be
interested in the fact that they know Angular 2, but it is much more important
that they are familiar with the fundamentals of Web Development and have a
proven ability to learn new technologies. Why? Because in 2 years' time their
Angular skills might be obsolete due to rising popularity of
FlavourOfTheMonth.JS.

In contrast, when selecting a developer for a 6-month project, their actual
granular skills are critically important. No matter how amazing someone's
fundamental knowledge of algorithms and data structures are, a 6-month project
requires people to hit the ground running. You don't have 4 weeks to learn a new
tech stack.

Solve for: Soft skills and product agnostic skills
There are quite a number of tools available in the market for assessing specific
technology skills. These are typically used during the recruitment process and
certainly help to weed out developers who don't really have the skills they are
claiming on their resumes. But these tools suffer from a critical shortcoming:
They equate "Skill" with "Technology"

In the real world, a capability is a combination of multiple skills that work
together. For example: the ability to build a RESTful service in SpringBoot, is
actually a combination of many skills, including abstraction, decomposition,
unit testing, component testing, debugging, HTTP, REST, JSON, Java, Spring,
SpringBoot and Maven. Not all of these skills can be easily assessed and neither
is it possible for a single learning resource to teach them all.

Building this capability by assembling multiple discrete skills is the magic of
the human brain.

And then I'm not even mentioning the various soft skills and process skills like
active listening, effective teamwork, principles of iterative development etc. A
holistic solution for skills management should not ignore this subtle reality of
skills.

Solve for: Map learning materials to skills
Because of the amorphous nature of skills, it is not always easy to define which
skills can be learned from any given learning resource. Additionally, different
resources teach skills at different levels of mastery. For example: A Docker
tutorial for Java developers would be very different from a Docker tutorial
targeted for Kubernetes administrators. And furthermore, both tutorials are
likely to be dependent on Linux OS skills.

We need an effective way to map which skills, at which levels, are taught by
which learning resources. Also, we need to know which skills are really
prerequisites for each learning resource.

Solve for: Establish reliable measurements of skill levels
Instead of chasing a holy grail of a single platform that will allow us to
assess and report all skills, we need to understand that different skills are
measured in different ways. We need to establish a standardised rating system,
but one that receives inputs from many review/rating sources. This may include
online technical assessments, but should also include 360 reviews and
self-assessments.

Solve for: Community-driven, flexible learning paths
One of the most frequent questions young developers ask me at the office is: 
What should I learn if I want to become X? 

Essentially they are asking me for a learning path which will encompass multiple
steps along the way, including courses, practical experience, certifications,
etc. Although I always try to give a well considered answer, the reality is that
my answers are incomplete. A better way is to establish a community-driven
process for assembling learning paths. This will ensure that the best learning
resources are selected based on recommendations across different content
providers.

Additionally, learning paths need to be customisable based on the needs of the
individual (or their tech lead)

Solve for: Identify over-served and under-served skills
I haven't done real research, but if you're searching the web for resources to
become a software developer, Google's first few pages are filled with resources
to teach front-end-driven development. This implies HTML5, CSS and
FlavourOfTheMonth.js

Sprinkled in between you will also find what is called full-stack development,
which focus on Node, Python or PHP.

Not that there is anything wrong with those technologies: They are amazing! But
the reality is that those skills are over-served in the learning content market,
while many other skills are almost ignored. It would be very useful to identify
which skills are under-served, so that we can spend more time to find
appropriate resources for them as well. This will help to build a balanced
learning journey that teaches technical tools and frameworks, but also
fundamentals.

Solve for: Cross-provider solution for tracking and rating
Most learning content providers offer very useful solutions for tracking your
learning progress on their platform, but this ignores the fact that a typical
person will learn from many different resources. We need a solution in which the
learning developer (and probably their tech lead) can track progress across
multiple resources from multiple providers.

Furthermore, we should have a trusted way to compare learning content from
different providers. For example: Should I invest my time learning technology X
using the beginner course on Udemy or Pluralsight?

Solve for: Skills exploration
To ensure your technology skills remain relevant, it is essential to be aware of
the things you don't know. This really comes down to: You must know what you
don't know.

I dream of a solution that uses fancy machine learning algorithms to establish a
recommendation engine for skills. Some attempts already exist, but we have some
way to go yet.

Solve for: Maximise microlearning opportunities
Given the vastness and the continuous evolution of the skills landscape, it is
inevitable that big-bang learning is nearing end-of-life. This has been replaced
with on-demand, self-paced learning. But doing isolated online courses every few
weeks is not enough: There is more value to be gained from regular, DAILY,
learning that moves towards a clearly defined goal. 

If we can combine carefully curated content with rapid assessments, such a micro
learning approach will result in better long-term returns. As they say: How do
you eat an elephant?

How now, brown cow?
So now that I've brain-dumped some of the practical things that I'd like to
tackle, I'm faced with the difficult question: Over the last 10 years of
starting, running and eventually selling a successful software development
company, I've been involved in skills-development the whole time. Why isn't this
problem solved yet?

Why do I still sound like Mrs Bennet when I complain about things not getting
done successfully (or at all) on many projects. Am I just a tiresome fool?
Probably (ask my wife), but there is another side to the story:

Until now I've been trying to solve the problem in a one-dimensional way, i.e. I
was not investing the time in analysing the full problem. Instead, I quickly:

* Identified the skills I felt the team needed
* Assembled a rigid list of learning resources (often without personally working through the material myself)
* Gave the learning path to the team, and 
* Left it at that (hoping osmosis would fill in the gaps)

I might be a bit harsh on myself, but that is really what I did. And the reason
(or so I keep telling myself) is that I never had enough time to tackle the
skills problem properly. 

Why wasn't there enough time? Because the first priority was always to deliver
projects. Because in my world, successful projects pay the bills.

Which brings us to the crux of the matter: This problem is absolutely solvable,
but it is not going to get solved automagically. Someone (actually a group of
someones) needs to roll up their sleeves and do it. And if I plan to be part of
that group, I have to figure out a way to pay the bills while doing it, so that
I can do it properly.

That's the journey.
