A consistent and very unfortunate aspect of the software engineering profession
is that we don't have clearly defined proficiency standards like other
professions and trades.

As a result, companies are forced to "roll-their-own" proficiency verification
processes. This results in tedious applicant screening processes that frustrate
everybody involved. But additionally, and I would argue more importantly, it
makes it difficult for practitioners to truly gauge their own proficiency,
which, in turn, makes it difficult to accurately plan our improvement and
learning journey.

So let's contrast this situation with any other profession, for example, the
accounting profession.

The accounting profession relies on a three-pronged approach for proficiency
standardisation. In most countries this is managed by an industry body which:

* Provides guidance to universities w.r.t curriculum design
* Administers industry entrance exams
* Administers mandatory annual professional development programs

The result of this approach is that anybody who carries the certification of "CA", or "CPA" (Depending on your country) can generally be assumed to have all
the relevant skills and knowledge to perform the role of an accountant.

For a professional technologist, the situation is a bit different. Of course,
there are many local and international industry bodies that we can belong to.
Organisations like the IEEE, IIBA, AEA and PMI spring to mind. Unfortunately
though, being a member of one of these bodies is largely voluntary and does not
guarantee a minimum level of proficiency. Perhaps I'm being harsh here, because
the PMI and IIBA have certainly made great strides towards standardising skills
in the project management and business analysis fields.

But this brings us to the field of software development, where the problem is
very pronounced. In certain pockets we do still have formal certifications that
guarantee a minimum standard (for example, the Oracle Java Certification path),
but the reality is that the skills needed by a modern developer has become too
broad and dynamic to be managed via a bureaucratic certification program. 

In many ways, our industry is a lot like the early days of the medical
profession, where anybody who wanted to call themselves a doctor could easily do so.

Which brings us to our current reality where recruiters employ tedious screening
processes and bespoke skills-assessment tests to determine whether a person's
actual skills match what their resume proclaims. While these processes may help
to separate the wheat from the chaff, there is still a significant amount of
subjectivity involved. And additionally, this focuses specifically on
recruitment, which is only a part of the problem.

I would love to be in a situation where we have an objective way for a person to
assess (and profess) their own skills. Most developer resumes include some form
of "Skills Matrix" which lists the person's skill and then offers a 5 level
rating system for specifying  their proficiency. Typically the levels are as
follows:

5 = High level of competence - extensive experience in the skill area <br />
4 = Moderately high level of competence - good experience in the skill area <br />
3 = Average level of competence – some experience in the skill area <br />
2 = Low level of competence – little experience in the skill area <br />
1 = No level of competence – no experience in the skill area <br />

In my opinion, such a definition of skill levels mean almost nothing, and I've
had countless examples where people claim to be a "level 5 expert" at a topic
that they know almost nothing about. The most memorable example was a junior
developer who claimed to be a PDF expert because he knew exactly how to download
and open any PDF document he found on the internet. He literally didn't even
know that it was possible to render a PDF document using a structured input
language like XML or LaTeX.

For DevSkillDojo I am therefore working on a simple, but objective, system for
assessing a person's technical proficiency in a given skill. The idea is that a
person should be able to objectively rate their own proficiency, which can then
serve as a great input to finding the correct learning path for the individual.
Such a system is valuable in many settings, including recruitment, project
allocation, career planning and skills development planning.

Effectively, I'm looking for a technical equivalent to the Interagency Language
Roundtable scale for language proficiency (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILR_scale)

Due to the broad nature of software development, I believe we will need to have:

* Generic definitions of proficiency levels.
* Specific definitions that apply at lower levels of the skills-tree which may override the generic definitions.

So effectively we are using the Object Oriented principle of inheritence for
managing proficiency levels. Fancy that.

Below are the generic definitions I am using as a starting point. Keep in mind,
that where the definitions can't be used for a specific skill in the ontology,
it will then be overridden.

#### Level 0: No Proficiency
I have no knowledge of this skill, or I may have some knowledge, but really only
enough to use the word correctly in a sentence.

#### Level 1: Fundamental Awareness (Basic Knowledge)
I have read up on this skill and worked through some tutorials.

#### Level 2: Novice (Limited Experience)
I have built a solution using this skill, without following steps in a tutorial,
i.e. getting the solution to work required some self-directed searching on
Google and StackOverflow. I generally expect help from a more experienced
practitioner to successfully apply this skill.

#### Level 3: Intermediate (Practical Application)
I have built multiple non-trivial solutions using this skill. Solutions include
at least one client project or, if the solution was a personal project, a
project published on the public internet. I may still require guidance from a
more experienced practitioner in some aspects, but generally I can apply the
skill independently.

#### Level 4: Experienced (Applied Theory)
Same as Intermediate plus: I have built one or more solutions in a project
leadership role with limited or no assistance from colleagues. I can apply this
skill entirely without assistance. Within my team, I am recognised as the
"Person to ask" when it comes to this particular skill. Additionally, I am able
to offer coaching to colleagues in this skill.

#### Level 5: Expert (Recognised Authority)
Same as Experienced plus: In addition to this particular skill, I am also
experienced in a number of alternative and complementary skills. As a result I
am able to evaluate (and lead) design decisions that are impacted by the
application of this skill. My broad knowledge in this particular skills domain
also allows me to understand how different components can work together to form
an end-to-end solution. Additionally, I can write and present training material,
reference materials and opinion pieces related to this skill.

These definitions are used in the DevSkillDojo skills domain model (https://devskilldojo.com/skills-framework/skills-domain-model/) as well
as the skills ontology (not published yet).

Note: I have taken a lot of inspiration from the Competencies Proficiency Scale
published by the NIH while compiling the above definitions (https://hr.nih.gov/working-nih/competencies/competencies-proficiency-scale).

Lastly, take note that I'll be posting regular updates from the DevSkillDojo
journey. If you'd like to come along for the ride, follow my blog (http://devskilldojo.com) and Twitter feed (@devskilldojo).
